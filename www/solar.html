				<strong>MERCURY</strong>
				<p />
				A small and harsh planet, closest to the sun, scorched and 
				barren. The composition of its surface is unknown due to 
				extreme conditions, and the oxygen/sodium/hydrogen atmosphere 
				is a far cry from what humans have known. Composed of denser 
				materials than the other planets, great and mysterious ores may 
				exist for those daring enough to extract them.

		<div class="venus planet info">
			<span>
				<strong>VENUS</strong>
				<p />
				The Evening Star. A harsh, hot, and unforgiving planet, covered 
				with an atmosphere of Carbon Dioxide over 6% as thick as water. 
				While the surface appears to hold a similar composition of Earth, 
				it is difficult determine what really exists there. The intense 
				heat, hundreds of degrees hotter than water's boiling point, 
				makes all but the most determined consider it a nightmare to attempt to exploit.

	<!-- Planet Earth -->
	<div>
		<div class="earth planet info">
			<span>
				<strong>EARTH</strong>
				<p />
				Home to humanity, a familiar place. A thin crust of rock surrounds 
				the molten core of the planet, covered with oceans of water, foliage, 
				and a rich nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The surface is covered with mineral 
				oxides, primarily Silicon, Aluminum, and Iron. Isolated in the universe 
				for so long, the wildlife is relatively tame with a few exceptions, though 
				how long can the Earth go without the touch of external forces?

	<!-- The Moon -->
	<div>
		<div class="earthmoon planet info">
			<span>
				<strong>MOON</strong>
				<p />
				The silent watcher of the earth. Large for a satellite but tiny for a planet, 
				the moon is cold and nearly without atmosphere, pock marked from the constant 
				pummeling of asteroids. The surface of the moon is much like Earth's: primarily 
				oxides of Silicon, Aluminum, Calcium, Iron, and Magnesium, though it is 
				impossible to know what all the asteroids have deposited there.

		<div class="mars planet info">
			<span>
				<strong>MARS</strong>
				<p />
				The Red Planet. A harsh place, covered primarily in Basalt and Iron Oxide, and a 
				very thin atmosphere of Carbon Dioxide. Long ago, Mars had surface water and a 
				habitable atmosphere, but these were swept away by solar radiation after it's 
				magnetic field dissipated. Could life had existed here in the past? Could 
				anything still survive this harsh, barren world?

	<!-- The Asteroid Belt -->
	<div>
		<div class="asteroid planet info">
			<span>
				<strong>ASTEROID BELT</strong>
				<p />
				A swathe of asteroids circling the sun, several hundred over 100km in diameter. 
				Spread over a vast distance, over twice as far from the sun as Earth, these 
				lifeless rocks contain material from all reaches of the solar system. The 
				lack of gravity and atmosphere make them harrowing places, though a determined 
				entrepreneur wouldn't be discouraged so easily.
				<p />
				Soon, the technology to harness the elements in asteroids will be completed.

				<strong>JUPITER</strong>
				<p />
				Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus). 
				It has been known since prehistoric times as a bright "wandering star". A hydrogen rich gas planet, 
				Jupiter presents challenges only the most skilled miners can overcome. Can you be the first to 
				capture all of the resources Jupiter has to offer?

				<strong>SATURN</strong>
				<p />
				Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in the Solar System, 
				after Jupiter. Named after the Roman god of agriculture, this planet poses unique challenges, 
				similar to Jupiter.

		<div class="neptune planet info">
			<span>
				<strong>NEPTUNE</strong>
				<p />
				A massive, dense planet, 17 times the size of Earth; Neptune is a diamond in the rough. If 
				you manage to make it to Neptune, vast riches await, in the form of gases. Can you make it 
				to this ice giant?

				<strong>URANUS</strong>
				<p />
				Uranus, named after the Greek sky deity Ouranos, the earliest of the lords of the heavens, 
				was the first planet to be discovered by scientists. Making it to this planet will be tough, 
				but the high concentration of helium will make it worth it.

		<div class="pluto planet info">
			<span>
				<strong>PLUTO</strong>
				<p />
				Pluto is the only dwarf planet to once have been considered a major planet. Once 
				thought of as the ninth planet and the one most distant from the sun, Pluto is 
				now seen as one of the largest known members of the Kuiper Belt, a shadowy 
				disk-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune populated by a trillion or more comets. It's 
				unknown what awaits you on this planet, but all signs point to a massive pay-off.
